h1. DIJON FRAMEWORK

A JS port of RobotLegs. Since it's substantially different from RL, I chose quite a different name.
"pronunciation":http://www.audioenglish.net/dictionary/dijon.htm

it's an acronym for:
*D*ependency *I*njection for *J*avaScript *O*bjects with *N*otifications ;)
I know, it's gibberish...

h2. FEATURES

* covariant injections (map an injection point for a baseclass and all instances of the mapped subclasses will have that dependency injected)
* framework independency. Doesn't rely on Prototype, JQuery or anything else.

h2. Coming from RobotLegs?

h3. Differences

Although most of the classes have the same names as in RL, the public API *AND* functionality of all of them differs (drastically) from their original namesakes.
Some concepts just don't make sense in a dynamic language as JS and therefore I chose to try and cherrypick the parts that do have benefits and cut away stuff that would make it cumbersome to use.

h2. Roadmap
* improvement of injection point mappings. It is pretty cumbersome at the moment and definitely needs the possibility of easier configuration
